# Final device QA — Phase 1

**Status: NOT STARTED. No real device has been tested.**

Everything below is a plan to be executed by a person holding hardware. Nothing
in this file may be marked done from an emulator, a resized desktop window, or
Playwright. Those find layout faults; they do not find the faults this document
exists to catch — iOS Safari's zoom-on-focus, Android keyboard resize, real
camera upload, and the 100vh address-bar problem.

## What automated checking already covers

Stated narrowly, because a manual tester who believes a screen is covered will
skip it. **Only these routes were measured, and only at these widths:**

| Route                                  | Widths         | Result                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/` teacher dashboard                  | 375, 390, 768  | 0px overflow; no target < 44px; no control < 16px |
| `/` teacher dashboard                  | 1440           | 0px overflow                                      |
| `/bagsh/huuhded/` children list        | 375, 768, 1440 | 0px overflow; no target < 44px at 375/768         |
| `/bagsh/ajiglalt/hyanah/` review queue | 375, 768, 1440 | as above                                          |
| `/medegdel/` announcements             | 375, 768, 1440 | as above                                          |

Teacher sidebar items measure 42px at 1440px only, where the input device is a
mouse; at 375 and 768 they are ≥44px.

**Not probed this session — assume nothing about them:** the observation form
(create and edit), the assessment group grid, teacher child detail, reports
request and status, comms detail, the profile screen, and every parent screen.
**1024px was not measured on any route.** These are the rows below that matter
most.

- **Authorization** — 958 tests, including HTTP-level 404 checks per CLAUDE.md §4.1.

**What no automated pass can cover, and why this document exists:** real touch
accuracy, real photo upload from a camera roll, real network latency, iOS
Safari's viewport and zoom-on-focus behaviour, Android's on-screen keyboard,
and whether Mongolian text renders in the fonts actually installed on a device.

## Devices

| #   | Device           | Browser | Owner | Status        |
| --- | ---------------- | ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| D1  | iPhone (iOS 17+) | Safari  | —     | ☐ not started |
| D2  | Android phone    | Chrome  | —     | ☐ not started |
| D3  | Desktop / laptop | Chrome  | —     | ☐ not started |
| D4  | Desktop / laptop | Safari  | —     | ☐ not started |

D1 and D2 are the priority: RFP §17 and CLAUDE.md §5 both put the phone first,
and parents will overwhelmingly use one.

## Parent flows

Run as a guardian account. Every screen must be legible one-handed.

## Cross-cutting checks

Run these on **D1 and D2 at minimum** — they are where the automated pass is blind.

| #   | Check                                                         | Why                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| X1  | No input zooms the page on focus                              | iOS Safari zooms under 16px and never zooms back |
| X2  | The on-screen keyboard never hides the field being typed into | Android resize behaviour                         |
| X3  | A sticky save bar never covers the last row of content        | Verified at 375px in code; confirm on glass      |
| X4  | Every Mongolian string renders — no boxes, no fallback serif  | Device fonts differ from the container's         |
| X5  | Rotate to landscape mid-form                                  | Input must not be lost                           |
| X6  | Reload mid-form                                               | Behaviour must be predictable                    |
| X7  | Slow network (throttle to 3G)                                 | RFP §17's 3-second budget                        |
| X8  | Offline, then back online                                     | Must fail clearly, not silently                  |
| X9  | Back/forward between screens                                  | No stale page, no resubmitted POST               |
| X10 | Tap accuracy on adjacent controls                             | 44px measured ≠ 44px comfortable                 |

## Security spot-checks on real hardware

These are covered by tests; confirming them on a device catches a proxy, cache,
or CDN layer that the test client never sees.

| #   | Check                                                | Expected                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| S1  | Edit the URL to another child's id                   | 404, not 403, and no data (RFP §21.4) |
| S2  | Copy a signed media URL and open it after ~5 minutes | Expired                               |
| S3  | Open a media URL while logged out                    | Refused                               |
| S4  | Confirm no photo is reachable at a guessable path    | CLAUDE.md §1.4                        |
