# Production readiness — Phase 1

**Assessed:** 2026-08-17, branch `feat/ui-redesign`, nothing committed.

Every item is **READY**, **MISSING**, **BLOCKED**, or **NEEDS CLIENT DECISION**.
READY means verified in the current working tree — not "written at some point".

**Overall: not deployable today.** Nothing is broken; four items need a value or
a decision that only the client can supply. They are listed in §9.

## 1. Application code

| #   | Item                           | Status    | Note                                                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.1 | Test suite                     | **READY** | 958 passing. Run with `--create-db`; two concurrent `--reuse-db` runs collide and report false failures. |
| 1.2 | Lint (`ruff`)                  | **READY** | Clean.                                                                                                   |
| 1.3 | Migration graph matches models | **READY** | `makemigrations --check --dry-run` → "No changes detected", after `accounts/0005`.                       |
| 1.4 | No hard deletes                | **READY** | Soft delete throughout; `AuditLog` append-only by design (CLAUDE.md §3.3).                               |
| 1.5 | Business logic outside views   | **READY** | `services.py` / `selectors.py`; the §20-IV API will reuse them.                                          |
| 1.6 | N+1 guards                     | **READY** | `assertNumQueries` on the six list screens.                                                              |

## 2. Authorization

| #   | Item                                    | Status    | Note                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.1 | Single authorization module             | **READY** | `apps/core/permissions.py`; CLAUDE.md §1.1.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2.2 | Kindergarten from enrollment history    | **READY** | One documented fallback for a child with no enrollments yet.                                                                                                                                   |
| 2.3 | Unauthorized access returns 404         | **READY** | Tested through the HTTP client, per CLAUDE.md §4.1 — not by calling the predicate.                                                                                                             |
| 2.4 | Revoked guardianship loses access       | **READY** | Fixed 2026-08-16. A soft-deleted `Guardianship` was still granting access through a reverse-relation join, which does not apply the related model's default manager. 5 tests fail if reverted. |
| 2.5 | Revoked teacher assignment loses access | **READY** | Same shape, same fix, in `GroupTeacher`. 8 tests fail if reverted.                                                                                                                             |
| 2.6 | Observations default to private         | **READY** | `visible_to_parents=False`; parent submissions are the deliberate exception.                                                                                                                   |
| 2.7 | No kindergarten in the session          | **READY** | Always derived from the object (CLAUDE.md §1.3).                                                                                                                                               |

## 3. Media

| #   | Item                                 | Status                    | Note                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3.1 | `MEDIA_URL` unset                    | **READY**                 | Deliberate; files are never served by Django's static handling.                                                                                            |
| 3.2 | Permission check before a signed URL | **READY**                 | `/media/<uuid>/<variant>/`, TTL 300s.                                                                                                                      |
| 3.3 | MIME sniffed from content            | **READY**                 | `python-magic`; extension never trusted (RFP §684).                                                                                                        |
| 3.4 | Random `storage_key`                 | **READY**                 | Real filename kept only in `original_name`, for display.                                                                                                   |
| 3.5 | Private bucket                       | **NEEDS CLIENT DECISION** | `prod.py` sets `default_acl: "private"`, but **the bucket itself must be created private**. See §9.2 — this is the single highest-consequence deploy step. |
| 3.6 | HEIC                                 | **READY (as scoped)**     | Recognised and refused with a clear message. Conversion is Phase 2 by design — but iPhones shoot HEIC by default, so expect parents to hit it. See §9.4.   |

## 4. Email — password reset

| #   | Item                    | Status                    | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4.1 | Reset actually sends    | **READY**                 | Fixed 2026-08-17. Until then the view printed the link to stdout and sent nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4.2 | Link never logged       | **READY**                 | Guarded by a test that reads the log records directly. `caplog`, `capsys` and `capfd` are all blind to this logger — each was tried and each passed against an empty string — so the test attaches its own handler and asserts the diagnostic _is_ present before asserting the link is not. |
| 4.3 | No existence oracle     | **READY**                 | Unknown address, known address and a dead mail server all return a byte-identical page.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4.4 | Failure is survivable   | **READY**                 | Logged for an administrator; a delivered link already in the user's inbox is not retired by a request whose send failed.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4.5 | SMTP credentials        | **MISSING**               | `EMAIL_HOST` and friends are wired to the environment and documented in `.env.example`, but **no host is configured**. See §9.1.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4.6 | `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`    | **MISSING**               | Defaults to `noreply@localhost`, which most receivers will reject. Needs a real address on the client's domain.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4.7 | Guardians with no email | **NEEDS CLIENT DECISION** | Phone-only guardians cannot self-reset; SMS is §20-IV. Today an administrator resets for them (RFP §2.1). Confirm that is acceptable for launch.                                                                                                                                             |

## 5. Configuration and secrets

| #   | Item                                                           | Status                     | Note                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.1 | No secrets in source                                           | **READY**                  | Everything through `os.environ`; `.env` gitignored.                                                                                                        |
| 5.2 | `.env.example` current                                         | **READY**                  | Includes the new email block.                                                                                                                              |
| 5.3 | `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`                                            | **READY (fails loudly)**   | No default — a deployment without it stops rather than starting with a guessable key.                                                                      |
| 5.4 | `DEBUG`                                                        | **READY**                  | Defaults to `False`; `prod.py` pins it.                                                                                                                    |
| 5.5 | `ALLOWED_HOSTS`                                                | **MISSING**                | Defaults to `[]`. Must carry the real domain.                                                                                                              |
| 5.6 | `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`                                  | **MISSING**                | Must carry the real `https://` origin or every POST fails behind the proxy.                                                                                |
| 5.7 | **`DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND` must not be `console` in production** | **MISSING (deploy check)** | The console backend writes the full reset link to the container log — reintroducing precisely the bug 4.1 removed. Verify this on the server after deploy. |

## 6. Infrastructure

| #   | Item                           | Status      | Note                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6.1 | HTTPS, HSTS, secure cookies    | **READY**   | `prod.py`: SSL redirect, HSTS 1 year with preload, secure session and CSRF cookies.                                                 |
| 6.2 | Deploy script                  | **READY**   | `scripts/deploy.sh`; same script first time and every time, refuses rather than guesses.                                            |
| 6.3 | Backup script                  | **READY**   | `scripts/backup.sh` dumps and reads the archive back — an unverified dump is not a backup.                                          |
| 6.4 | Backups copied off the machine | **MISSING** | Documented in `DEPLOYMENT.md` but not automated. A backup on the database's own disk survives nothing that would make you want one. |
| 6.5 | Restore rehearsed              | **MISSING** | `restore.sh` exists; it has not been run against a real archive. An untested restore is a hope.                                     |
| 6.6 | Health check                   | **READY**   | `/healthz`.                                                                                                                         |
| 6.7 | Celery worker and beat         | **READY**   | In the prod compose file; PDF generation and report expiry both depend on it.                                                       |
| 6.8 | Static files                   | **READY**   | WhiteNoise with a manifest storage.                                                                                                 |
| 6.9 | Log retention and access       | **MISSING** | No rotation policy, and no statement of who can read production logs. Audit logs are in the database; container logs are not.       |

## 8. Known scope boundaries (not defects)

Phase 2 by agreement, recorded so nobody reads them as gaps at acceptance:
full portfolio timeline, milestones, photo albums, growth tracking, annual
report (§6.5), document library, Excel export, activity posts, consent
records, HEIC conversion. Phase 3: surveys, analytics, attendance, health and
medication, voice notes, WebP and thumbnails, CDN, QPay. Never: native apps.

## 9. What blocks deployment

Four items. The first two are values; the last two are conversations.

### 9.1 — SMTP credentials (MISSING)

Password reset is wired end to end and tested, but no mail host is configured.
Without it the first reset raises on send. Needs a host, port, user, password
and a real `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` on the client's domain.

### 9.2 — Object storage bucket (NEEDS CLIENT DECISION)

The application asks for private objects and signs every URL, but that is not
sufficient on its own: **a public bucket would expose every child's photograph
regardless of what the application does.** The bucket must be created private
and confirmed private. This is the one item where a mistake is unrecoverable —
photographs of children, published, with no way to un-publish.

### 9.3 — UI sign-off (NEEDS CLIENT DECISION)

The interface was deliberately simplified away from a literal reproduction of
the 21 approved mockups, on instruction (2026-08-16): one screen, one job; no
children × 9-domain matrix; no charts. `docs/MOCKUP_FIDELITY_AUDIT.md` records
the divergence and `docs/UI_UX_MAP.md` records what was built. **§21.15 makes
the approved UI an acceptance criterion, so the client must sign off on the
simplified direction before acceptance, not after.**

### 9.4 — HEIC uploads (NEEDS CLIENT DECISION)

iPhones shoot HEIC by default. Phase 1 refuses it with a clear message rather
than converting. Parents on iPhones will meet this on their first upload.
Confirm that a clear refusal is acceptable for launch, or pull conversion
forward from Phase 2 — which is a scope change, not a fix.

## 10. Before the first deploy

In order. None of these is optional.

1. Fill every value in `.env` from `.env.example`; confirm `DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND`
   is **not** the console backend (§5.7).
2. Create the object storage bucket **private**, then verify from outside that a
   known key 403s (§9.2).
3. Send one real password reset end to end, on a real device.
4. Run `scripts/backup.sh`, then **restore it into a scratch database** (§6.5).
   A backup nobody has restored is not a backup.
5. Copy an archive off the machine and confirm it arrives (§6.4).
6. Complete `docs/FINAL_DEVICE_QA.md` on a real iPhone and a real Android phone.
7. Get §21.15 sign-off in writing (§9.3).
