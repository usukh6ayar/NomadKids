# ROADMAP — Бяцхан Нүүдэлчид

Children's Development Digital Portfolio System.

**Status as of 2026-08-12: Phase 1 in progress — 14 of 17 requirement groups
complete, 3 partial, 0 not started.** Detail in section 7. The three partials
are deployment (provider chosen — D3 — but never run against a server),
responsive layout on real devices, and the REST API (deferred by decision D2).

This file is kept in sync with the codebase. Every "done" below names the file
or test that proves it.

## 0. Reconciling three numbering schemes

Three documents number their stages differently. When the client says "Phase 1"
they mean the commercial milestone in this file.

| Scheme                | Where                                               | Meaning                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1 / 2 / 3**   | this file                                           | Commercial delivery milestones, with budgets |
| Steps 1–11            | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-…-design.md` §14 | Implementation order inside the build        |
| §20 I / II / III / IV | `Project_Info.md`                                   | The client's own RFP staging                 |

Rough mapping: ROADMAP Phase 1 ≈ RFP §20-II (MVP) minus growth tracking and
the document library; Phase 2 ≈ §20-II reporting plus §20-III; Phase 3 ≈ the
RFP's Module 1, Module 2 and appendix.

## 1. Project overview

A web system where kindergarten teachers record observations and assessments,
guardians contribute information about their child, and the system builds a
per-child development portfolio for ages 2–5 that can be exported as a
printable PDF.

`Project_Info.md` (the client's RFP, in Mongolian) is the primary source of
truth for product requirements. This roadmap schedules that work; it does not
replace it.

**Web only.** No iOS, Android, React Native or Expo application. The backend is
structured so a mobile client can be added later without rewriting business
logic, but no mobile work happens now.

## 2. Product goals

- Give teachers a fast way to record what they observe, without paperwork
- Give guardians a real window into their child's development
- Preserve a child's whole 2–5 history even across group, year and
  kindergarten changes
- Produce a printable Mongolian-language portfolio the family keeps
- Keep children's personal data safe enough to pass RFP §21

## 3. User roles

| Role         | Scope               | Source                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `superadmin` | System-wide         | Registers kindergartens, backups, all users       |
| `admin`      | One kindergarten    | Teachers, groups, assignments, reports (RFP §2.1) |
| `teacher`    | Own assigned groups | RFP §2.2                                          |
| `guardian`   | Own linked children | RFP §2.3                                          |

Roles live on `Membership`, not on `User`, so one person can hold several —
a teacher whose own child attends the same kindergarten, or a guardian with
children at two kindergartens.

## 4. Technology stack

| Layer          | Choice                                     | Status                                                     |

> **Correction, 2026-08-16.** This row read "Django templates + HTMX + Alpine"
> from Day 1 to today. Neither library was ever added. A grep of `templates/`,
> `static/` and `apps/` for `htmx` and `alpine` returns nothing, and there is
> not a single `<script src=…>` tag in the entire template tree.
>
> What is actually there:
>
> - `static/css/app.css` — 669 lines, the only stylesheet
> - two short inline `<script>` blocks, both in the theme partials, which read
>   `localStorage` to apply the remembered theme before first paint
> - no build step, no package manager in the serving path, no external CDN
>
> The claim was aspirational when it was written and nobody went back to it.
> It is corrected here rather than resolved by adding the libraries, because
> every §17 page-load target is already met without them.
>
> This matters for the presentation-layer work in `docs/STACK_DECISION.md`:
> the redesign starts from plain server-rendered HTML and one stylesheet, so
> there is no framework to work around — and no CDN dependency to break under

## 5. Architecture overview

```
models/       data structure only
   │
services/     ALL business rules and authorization — single source of truth
   │
   ├── views/    Django templates (the web app)
   └── api/      DRF, added when a mobile client exists
```

```
apps/core/       base models, permissions, audit log, PDF, admin site
apps/accounts/   User, Membership, profiles, login, invitations
apps/tenants/    Kindergarten, SchoolYear, Group, GroupTeacher
apps/children/   Child, Guardianship, Enrollment
apps/portfolio/  AboutMe, ChildAgeProfile, BirthdayNote
apps/observations/
                 ObservationType, Observation, ObservationDomain
apps/assessment/ DevelopmentDomain, AssessmentScale, AssessmentLevel,
                 Term, Assessment
apps/media/      MediaFile, ObservationMedia — upload and signed serving
apps/comms/      Announcement, AnnouncementTarget, AnnouncementRead
apps/reports/    ReportJob — the §549 render queue
apps/dashboard/  no models; §12.1 and §12.2 figures
```

Three URL zones with three layouts: `/bagsh/` (teacher), `/etseg-eh/`
(guardian), `/udirdlaga/` (administrator). `/hawtas/` is shared: the portfolio,
the observations and the assessment record are all one artifact that a teacher
and a guardian both reach, so each has one set of views that picks its layout
per request. The §6.3 group grid is the exception — it is teacher-only and
lives under `/bagsh/`.

**The authorization rule that shapes everything:** a child's kindergarten is
derived from their `Enrollment` history, never from `Child.kindergarten_id`.
That field changes when a child transfers, which would otherwise silently
revoke the previous teacher's access to observations they wrote themselves.
Full reasoning in spec section 4.2.

## 6. Development phases

| Phase                         | Objective                                | Budget      | Duration |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **1 — Core MVP**              | Core workflows working end to end        | 3,000,000 ₮ | 10 days  |
| **2 — Reporting & portfolio** | Full portfolio, gallery, growth, reports | 6,000,000 ₮ | TBC      |
| **3 — Advanced SaaS**         | Surveys, analytics, health, payments     | 8,000,000 ₮ | TBC      |

Phase 2 does not start until Phase 1 is stable and Phase 2 scope is
explicitly confirmed.

## 7. Phase 1 — Core MVP (current)

**Objective:** a functional, usable web MVP with the core workflows working
end to end.

**Dependencies:** hosting decision (section 15) blocks deployment.

### Delivered ahead of schedule

`AuditLog` (who viewed, edited and downloaded what) is a Phase 3 item in the
original brief. It was built in Phase 1 because RFP §971 requires it and
retrofitting an audit trail after data exists is painful. No extra cost.

### Deliverables

Working web application, source code, migrations, `.env.example`, seed data
command, test suite, [deployment instructions](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), this
roadmap.

### Explicitly out of scope for Phase 1

Full reporting engine · advanced gallery (HEIC, compression, albums, ordering)
· growth tracking · document library · Excel import/export · surveys ·
analytics · health & safety · attendance · medication · voice notes · CDN and
WebP · payments · smart pickup · mobile apps · AI · multi-language.

## 8. Phase 2 — Reporting & digital portfolio

**Objective:** expand the MVP into a complete web product.

Full digital portfolio (complete 2–5 history, timeline, gallery, milestones) ·
advanced gallery (multi-upload, albums, captions, categories, ordering,
HEIC/JPG/PNG, compression) · growth tracking with charts · the rest of §10.2's
report types (annual, development profile, growth, group, batch — the child
portfolio and the term report shipped in Phase 1) ·
advanced PDF (A4, Cyrillic, page numbers, logo, photos, charts, print-ready,
optimized size) · teacher document library with versions and bookmarks ·
Excel import/export · improved dashboards.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 stable; Celery worker in real use; object storage
decided and live.

**Out of scope:** everything listed under Phase 3.

## 9. Phase 3 — Advanced SaaS platform

Surveys and questionnaires · advanced analytics (start-vs-end, year-to-year,
radar, group and kindergarten comparison) · five-sheet Excel analytics ·
health & safety, attendance, allergies, vaccinations · medication management ·
daily highlights, voice notes, speech-to-text · advanced audit trail
(partially delivered in Phase 1) · WebP, thumbnails, CDN · tuition invoices,
QPay/SocialPay.

## 10. Current sprint — the 10-day Phase 1 plan

> The Day 8 version of this table still showed Day 7 as "next" and Day 8 as
> not started, both contradicted by the progress log immediately below it.
> The log is written at the end of each day; this table was not.

**Position: end of Day 10.** Two things stand between here and handover, and
neither is code this side can write alone: the application has never been
deployed, because the hosting decision (D3) is the client's; and the layout
has never been opened on a real phone. Days 1–10 also produced work not on the original
plan — the invitation system, the audit log, the administrator workspace and
the Cyrillic PDF spike — which is why the remaining days are tight rather than
comfortable. Full record in section 21.

## 11. Database entities

**Built — 34 models, plus 3 history mirrors:**

```
core         AuditLog
accounts     User · Membership · TeacherProfile · GuardianProfile ·
             Invitation · LoginAttempt · PasswordResetToken
tenants      Kindergarten · SchoolYear · Group · GroupTeacher
children     Child · Guardianship · Enrollment
portfolio    AboutMe · ChildAgeProfile · BirthdayNote
observations ObservationType · Observation · ObservationDomain
assessment   DevelopmentDomain · DevelopmentIndicator · AssessmentScale ·
             AssessmentLevel · Term · Assessment
media        MediaFile · ObservationMedia
comms        Announcement · AnnouncementTarget · AnnouncementRead ·
             AnnouncementAttachment
reports      ReportJob

history      HistoricalChild · HistoricalAboutMe · HistoricalChildAgeProfile
```

`DevelopmentIndicator` is built but unused: assessment is per domain in
Phase 1 (§6.4, §6.5 and §12.3 all aggregate that way). The table and the
nullable `Assessment.indicator` column exist so finer criteria can be added
later without migrating assessment rows that already exist.

**Nothing further is needed for Phase 1.** The remaining work is
deployment and hardening, not schema.

Conventions: `kindergarten_id` on every tenant-scoped table, soft delete
everywhere except `AuditLog`, authorship columns on every row, and
administrator-editable lists as tables rather than enums. Full schema in the
design spec section 6.

## 12. API modules

Phase 1 ships a server-rendered web application. Views call `services/`
directly as in-process Python — no HTTP round trip to our own API, which would
double latency for no benefit (RFP §17 wants 3-second page loads).

The service layer is the API boundary. When a mobile client exists, DRF
endpoints call the same functions, so the rules cannot drift between web and
mobile. **See decision D2.**

## 13. Security requirements

| Requirement                             | Status                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Password hashing                        | ✅ Django hasher; 8+ chars with upper, lower and digit                     |
| Role-based authorization                | ✅ from `Membership`                                                       |
| Backend ownership checks                | ✅ `apps/core/permissions.py`, one place only                              |
| No cross-child access by changing an id | ✅ verified end to end: 200 for own, 404 for another                       |
| Secure file access                      | ✅ private bucket, permission check then signed URL — `apps/media/`        |
| HTTPS                                   | ⬜ arrives with deployment; `prod.py` already sets HSTS and secure cookies |
| Input validation                        | ✅ forms and service-level validation                                      |
| Injection / XSS                         | ✅ ORM parameterisation, template auto-escaping                            |
| Secure cookies and sessions             | ✅ HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure in production                                |
| Login throttling                        | ✅ 5 failures → 15 minutes, survives request rollback                      |
| Audit log                               | ✅ login, failures, views, changes, invitations, activations               |
| No secrets in source                    | ✅ all config from the environment; `.env` gitignored                      |

404 rather than 403 on unauthorized access, always: a 403 confirms the record
exists, which is itself a disclosure.

## 14. File storage strategy

Child photos are sensitive (RFP §4.4, §15, §21.10).

- Files are never reachable by URL. `GET /media/<uuid>/<variant>/` runs the
  permission check, then issues a short-lived signed URL
- `storage_key` is a random UUID path; the real filename is display-only
- MIME type is detected from content, never from the extension
- Storage is behind Django's storage abstraction, so local, MinIO and S3 are
  interchangeable

**Phase 1 scope: simple secure upload only** — child profile photo and
observation attachments. HEIC conversion and compression are Phase 2; WebP,
thumbnails and CDN are Phase 3. **See decision D3.**

## 15. Deployment strategy

```
Development   docker-compose: web, worker, beat, postgres, redis, minio
Staging       same shape, separate database
Production    web, worker, beat, postgres, redis + external object storage
```

All configuration from environment variables, `/healthz` checks database and
cache, `scripts/backup.sh` and `scripts/restore.sh` for the dump and the
documented way back (run from cron on the server, and copied off the machine —
a backup on the database's own disk survives nothing that matters), and no production
data or real child photos in development (RFP §707 — `seed_demo` refuses to
run with `DEBUG` off).

**Target: Hetzner Cloud, Singapore region, with Cloudflare R2 for files**
(decision D3, 2026-08-11 — chosen on measured latency from Ulaanbaatar),
**with DigitalOcean SGP1 as the named fallback** (D3 addendum, 2026-08-18).
The procedure is in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), the first-time
walkthrough for either provider in [`docs/SERVER-SETUP.md`](docs/SERVER-SETUP.md),
and `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `Caddyfile` and `scripts/deploy.sh` are written
and their refusals exercised. What is missing is a server.

> **Not a serverless platform.** Asked about Vercel on 2026-08-11. It cannot
> host this: RFP §549 requires PDF rendering in a worker outside the request,
> and a serverless runtime has no persistent worker; WeasyPrint needs
> `libcairo` and `libpango`, and §684's MIME sniffing needs `libmagic`, none
> of which install on a managed Python runtime. There is also no separate
> front end to host — every screen is a Django template.

> ⚠️ **Still not deployed.** Everything on this side is ready — production
> settings pass Django's checklist, the static build runs, backup and restore
> are scripted and rehearsed — but the application has never served a real
> request. That is the last open Definition-of-Done item.

## 16. Testing checklist

Formal QA is the client's. Before handover we still verify:

| Check                                       | Status                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**23 of 24 met.**

"Production build works" means what was actually run on Day 9: the project
starts under `config.settings.prod`, `manage.py check --deploy` reports
nothing but the placeholder `SECRET_KEY` from the development `.env`, and
`collectstatic` post-processes all 640 files through WhiteNoise's manifest
storage — the step that fails loudly when a stylesheet references a file that
is not there. It does not mean the application has served traffic in
production; that is the row below it, and it stays ❌ until D3 is answered.

## 18. Out of scope for Phase 1

See section 7. In short: anything in Phase 2 or Phase 3, plus native mobile
applications in any form.

## 19. Future features

Beyond Phase 3, the RFP anticipates: multi-language, AI-assisted observation
suggestions, digital signatures, integration with government systems, and
push notifications.

## 20. Development rules

Binding rules are in `CLAUDE.md` and are not restated here. The ones that
shape scheduling:

- Authorization lives in exactly one file; every new view touching child data
  ships with three 404 tests written through the HTTP client
- Business logic in `services.py`, never in views — the mobile client will
  call the same functions
- No hard deletes; `AuditLog` is append-only
- Slow work (PDF, image processing) goes to Celery, never inside a request
- Never claim a feature works without running the tests and showing the output
- Update this roadmap after every major feature: mark completed items, record
  architectural decisions, record blockers

---

## 21. Progress log

What was actually delivered, in order, with the decisions and blockers each
day produced. Updated after every major feature.

### Day 1 — 2026-08-07 · Foundation

`115b08d` `0dad690`

Docker environment (web, worker, beat, PostgreSQL 17, Redis, MinIO), Django
project with split settings, `User` / `Membership`, the authorization layer,
and the Cyrillic PDF spike. Then the full authentication flow: login by
username, email or phone; lockout; password reset; `AuditLog`.

**Decisions.** Authorization derives from `Enrollment` history, not
`Child.kindergarten_id` — the field changes on transfer and would silently
revoke a teacher's access to their own observations. Roles live on
`Membership`, not `User`, so one person can be both a teacher and a guardian.
Authentication views carry `transaction.non_atomic_requests`, or
`ATOMIC_REQUESTS` rolls the lockout counter back with the failed request.

**Risk closed.** Mongolian Cyrillic renders in PDF: DejaVu Sans embedded in
the image covers Ө ө Ү ү, verified by reading the font's character map and by
parsing the generated file. A printed A4 page still needs a human's eyes.

### Day 2 — 2026-08-08 · Administrator workspace

`14bf0e4`

`/udirdlaga/` as a separate admin site: kindergartens, school years, groups,
teacher assignment. Organizational rules in `tenants/services.py`.

**Decisions.** Admin access comes from `Membership`, not `is_staff` — granting
a director `is_staff` would hand them Django's raw superuser site as a side
effect. Every list and every foreign-key dropdown is filtered by the user's
kindergartens, and object lookups go through `get_queryset` so another
kindergarten's record is _not found_ rather than _forbidden_.

**Security fix.** Django's own admin login was a second authentication path
that skipped the lockout and the audit log, leaving administrator accounts as
the only unthrottled way in. It now redirects to the project's login view.

### Day 3–4 — 2026-08-08 · Children, guardians, onboarding

`c47fd67` `591a91e` `5e70335` `045587b`

Client mockups read and catalogued. Design decisions applied to the auth
screens. Invitation-based account creation. Child registration, the teacher
list and detail screens, and the guardian home.

**Decisions.** Nobody self-registers: the `Guardianship` row _is_ the §21.3
authorization boundary, so it cannot be created by the person it grants access
to. Staff create the account; the person activates it and sets their own
password. Two delivery paths — an emailed link, and identifier plus a
six-digit code on paper, since Mongolian guardians frequently have no email.
The code is never checked alone; six digits is searchable, but not when the
attacker must also know the phone number and beat the attempt throttle.

`visible_children()` was added as the list-level counterpart to
`can_access_child()`, with a test asserting the two agree over every user and
child in the fixtures — a child listed but 404ing when opened is a bug, and
the reverse is a disclosure.

**Bug fixed.** `unique(child, school_year)` blocked RFP §3.4: a mid-year group
change puts two enrollments in one year. Now unique on _active_ enrollments
only, which is what the rule actually means.

### Day 5 — 2026-08-09 · Portfolio and documentation alignment

`4694c8b` `c97f2f1` `323cebe` `93f5db0` `2e8c38f`

This roadmap written from the client's brief. All other documents aligned to
its phase boundaries. Then `apps/portfolio`: About Me, birthday notes, and the
four age pages.

**Decisions.** D1 and D2 resolved — growth tracking, the document library,
term and annual reports, milestones, albums, activity posts and consent move
to Phase 2; the REST API stays deferred. (D1 was later amended: the term
report came back into Phase 1 on 2026-08-12.) The media plan corrected: Phase 1
verifies the MIME type and strips EXIF GPS only, and does both inline.

Zodiac sign and year animal are computed, never stored (§206). The portfolio
has one set of views for both roles, because it is one artifact both write to;
duplicating them per role would be two copies of the same rules drifting
apart. The two notes are kept apart in the service, not the template.

**Known limitation.** The year animal uses the calendar year. Цагаан сар falls
in January or February, so January birthdays may be off by one until a lunar
table is added. Documented in `zodiac.py`.

### Day 6 — 2026-08-09 · Observations and development assessment

`apps/observations` and `apps/assessment`: the §5.1 entry form, the §5.4
parent-submission and review flow, the §6.4 term matrix on a child's page,
and the §6.3 grid that assesses a whole group from one screen. The nine
development domains, the four levels and the four observation types ship as
system defaults.

**Decisions.** The configuration lists are **system-wide with per-kindergarten
additions** — `kindergarten = NULL` is the shared default, and a kindergarten
adds rows rather than editing them. One director renaming "Хэл яриа" must not
rename it for everyone. The "system OR mine" condition lives in one selector
per app; copied into each screen it would eventually be forgotten in one, and
that screen would leak another kindergarten's configuration.

Assessment stays **per domain**, not per indicator: §6.4, §6.5 and §12.3 all
aggregate that way. `DevelopmentIndicator` and the nullable
`Assessment.indicator` are built and left empty so finer criteria can arrive
without migrating existing rows.

A school year now creates its four terms on save. `Assessment.term` is
required, so a year without terms is one in which nothing can be assessed —
a state a director would have hit before ever reaching the term screen.

**Authorization widened, deliberately and narrowly.** `can_record_for_child`
joins `can_access_child` in `permissions.py`. Reading a child's record and
writing a professional one about them are different rights: a guardian may
read the portfolio and write their own half of it (§2.3), but observations
and assessments are the teacher's record. It is defined as
`can_access_child` _minus the guardian branch_ — the first draft was "has
access and holds a staff role somewhere", and a test caught what that
allows: a teacher whose own child attends the same kindergarten could file a
teacher observation about their own child while teaching a different group.

**Bug fixed, and it was ours.** The `django_db(transaction=True)` tests — the
authentication ones, which need the lockout counter to survive a rollback —
flush every table at teardown, taking migration-created rows with them. Any
test collected afterwards found an empty configuration. The system defaults
now live in `apps/assessment/defaults.py`, called both by the migrations and
by an autouse fixture in `conftest.py`. A full-suite pass before this fix was
not evidence of anything; it depended on which database happened to be reused.

**Second security fix, from review.** `can_record_for_child` surviving a
transfer is correct — but it does not follow that a teacher may write _new_
records at the kindergarten the child moved to, which is a row inside
another tenant (§3.2). Every write now also passes `assert_writable`, which
asks `visible_kindergartens` rather than inventing a second rule. The same
gate covers editing, archiving, reviewing, and opening a term to the
guardians: after a transfer a term holds rows from both sides, and each
kindergarten publishes only its own.

Three smaller ones with it: the observation domain list was validated but
the _assessment_ domain was not, so a crafted request could attach another
kindergarten's private domain and pollute its §12.3 averages; `assessed_at`
was `auto_now`, so publishing a term restamped every row as if the children
had just been reassessed; and the §6.3 grid built a `pk__in` straight from
attacker-controlled form field names, where a non-numeric key was a 500
rather than a no-op. `Term` also gained the `kindergarten` column §3.2
requires on every tenant-scoped table.

**Known limitation.** An observation's evidence photo and attachment (§5.1)
and the §5.3 side-by-side comparison of a child's work both need `MediaFile`,
which arrives with upload on Day 7. The parent submission screen is Day 7 as
well; the service, the review flow and the guardian's read path are done and
tested.

### Day 7 — 2026-08-09 · Parent observations, media, announcements

Three things that had been waiting on each other. `apps/media` — upload,
storage and the signed-URL serving path. `apps/comms` — §8.1 announcements
with targeting and read receipts. And the §5.4 screens that the Day 6
service layer had no interface for.

**Files are never reachable by URL.** `GET /media/<uuid>/<variant>/` runs
`can_access_child` and only then produces a link (spec section 7.1). The path
in the URL is a `public_id` UUID, separate from both the primary key and the
storage key, so files are neither enumerable nor a map of the bucket layout.
`storage_key` is a random sharded UUID path; the real filename is display-only
and never reaches the backend, because it usually contains the child's name.

**EXIF GPS is stripped on every upload**, which the RFP does not ask for. A
phone embeds the coordinates of wherever the photo was taken, so a leaked
photo taken at home carries the child's home address. The strip is a
re-encode through Pillow, which also discards anything else a file might be
carrying. The test builds a JPEG that really has coordinates in it and reads
them back afterwards — a test that cannot create the dangerous input proves
nothing.

**MIME type is read from the content**, never the extension or the browser's
claim (§684). Three tests push a shell script, a PDF and random bytes through
as `.jpg`.

**Decisions.** Development points at MinIO through the same S3 backend
production uses, so the signing path is exercised while building rather than
discovered on deployment day; `make storage` creates the bucket, because
MinIO starts with none and the failure otherwise reads as
`NoSuchBucket` with nothing on screen to explain it. `MEDIA_REDIRECT_SIGNED_URL`
decides whether the view redirects or streams — production redirects so the
object store moves the bytes; development streams because MinIO signs for
`minio:9000`, a hostname only the containers can resolve. Both branches run
the permission check first, and both are tested.

`file_url` accepts **only absolute URLs**. A local backend answers `url()`
with a path instead of raising, and redirecting there would 404 today — or,
if anyone ever set `MEDIA_URL`, hand the file over with no check at all.

The parent's submission form is a separate screen from the teacher's rather
than the same one with fields hidden. §5.1 asks a teacher for a professional
judgement — the domains, the support plan, who may see it — and none of that
is a parent's to give. Opening the teacher's form as a guardian is now a 404
rather than a form that offers fields the service will refuse.

**Announcement targeting is a table, not a column.** §8.1 allows one notice
aimed at three groups plus two named children at once. No target rows means
the whole kindergarten. The reach rule is written once, in
`comms/selectors.py`, and starts from `visible_children`, so no targeting
choice can reach a family that is not connected to the child. Unlike the
§6.3 grid, an unreachable id here is **refused rather than dropped**: a lost
keystroke is an annoyance, a misdirected message about a child is not.

**Known limitation.** HEIC uploads are refused with a sentence in Mongolian
rather than converted — the conversion is Phase 2 (spec section 7). Thumbnails,
WebP and multi-file upload are Phase 2 and Phase 3.

### Day 8 — 2026-08-10 · PDF, dashboards, the rest of the filters

`apps/reports` and `apps/dashboard`, plus the §11 filters that were written
in a selector on Day 3 and never reached a form.

**The queue finally earns its keep.** A child's portfolio runs to several
pages with a photograph; §549 says the system must not freeze while it
renders, so the request creates a `ReportJob` and returns, and a Celery
worker does the work. The dispatch goes through `transaction.on_commit` —
`ATOMIC_REQUESTS` wraps the whole request, and a bare `.delay()` can reach a
worker before the row it needs is committed (CLAUDE.md §6.1). There is a
test for exactly that, because the failure mode is a worker that
intermittently finds nothing.

**The PDF is verified by reading it back.** The Day 1 spike proved DejaVu
Sans covers Ө and Ү; this renders a real portfolio and parses the output
with `pypdf` to confirm the child's name, the section headings and the page
counter survived. Page count comes from WeasyPrint's own layout rather than
from re-parsing the file, so production needs no PDF library for one
integer.

**A report contains what the requester may see, not what the worker could
reach.** `builder.py` scopes every queryset to `job.requested_by`: a
guardian's copy holds approved, visible observations and published
assessments, a teacher's holds theirs. Rendering everything and hiding the
rest in the template would be one forgotten `{% if %}` away from handing a
family another kindergarten's notes. A job also belongs to whoever asked for
it — a guardian opening a teacher's job id gets 404, not the teacher's copy.

**Decisions.** `CACHES` now points at Redis. §12.2's figures are computed by
a beat task and read by the web process; Django's default cache is
per-process memory, so the worker would have filled a cache nobody else
could see and every page load would have recomputed anyway. The beat
schedule lives in code, not in the database, so a fresh deployment has it
without anyone remembering to click. §12.1's teacher dashboard is _not_
cached: a teacher recording an observation and not seeing the count move is
worse than the query, and one group is twenty-five children.

Landing after login now goes to the dashboard rather than straight to a list
of names — §12.1 is a list of what a teacher needs to notice on arriving.

**Known limitation.** `ruff` was not re-run after this day's changes: Docker
Desktop died mid-session and its cache directory was left corrupted. The
test suite ran in full afterwards and passed; the lint gate is outstanding
and is the first thing to run on Day 9.

### Day 9 — 2026-08-10 · the lint gate, error pages, backup, and a leak

Planned as security, responsive fixes, deployment, backup and error handling.
Deployment was deferred with the client (D3); the rest landed, and one thing
nobody had planned for turned up on the way.

**Days 6–8 were never committed.** Three days of work — six new apps, about
nineteen models and two hundred tests — existed only in the working tree.
`ruff --fix` rewrites files in place, so the day started by committing that
tree as `4e8e14c` before anything touched it.

**`ruff` finally ran, and had nothing to say.** The Day 8 debt closes with
`All checks passed!`. Worth recording that the lint gate found nothing while
the defect below sat in twenty-six templates: lint checks Python, and this
was in the HTML.

**Django's `{# ... #}` does not span lines.** The lexer matches comments with
`{#.*?#}` and no DOTALL flag, so a comment written across several lines is
not a comment at all. The text becomes literal output, and any `{% ... %}`
inside it is parsed as a real tag. Both consequences were present:

- Thirty-seven comments across thirty-one templates were rendering as
  visible text. `base_teacher.html` emitted its own English design notes
  immediately after `<!doctype html>` — on every page a teacher opened.
- `reports/child_portfolio.html` has no `{% extends %}`, so its fourteen-line
  header comment went into **the PDF**. Every child portfolio generated
  since Day 8 carried "RFP §10.1, §10.3 · Cyrillic — DejaVu Sans, installed
  in the image…" printed on page one. That is the document that goes to a
  family.

The Day 8 entry recorded that the PDF was verified by parsing it back rather
than by looking at it, and named the printed page as unchecked. This is what
that gap cost. The page-count and Cyrillic assertions passed the whole time,
because they asked whether certain text was present, never whether other
text was absent.

Two guards, at different levels. `apps/core/tests/test_templates.py` lexes
every template and fails on a `{#` that survives into a text token — the
source-level rule, which also catches the next one written. The PDF test now
asserts that "RFP", "CLAUDE.md" and `{#` do **not** appear in the extracted
text — the artefact-level rule, on the one output that leaves the building.
The second was confirmed by restoring the old template and watching it fail
before the fix went back in.

**Error pages.** 400, 403, 404, 500 and the CSRF failure page, in Mongolian,
self-contained: no static tag, no context processors, no database. A 500 is
rendered by Django's own handler with an empty context, and the reason it
fired may well be the database — a page that needs one is a page that fails
when it is needed. They carry no navigation either, which is the §21.4 rule
seen from the other side: a 404 from `can_access_child()` has to look like a
mistyped address, and a sidebar naming the review queue would describe the
system to someone who should learn nothing from it.

Nothing routes to these templates and nothing imports them — Django finds
them by filename — so the tests go through the request cycle. They only work
because `DEBUG` is False under test, which is also why writing them broke
thirty-nine authorization tests before the comment bug was understood.

**Backup and restore.** `scripts/backup.sh` dumps through the `db` container,
so the host needs no PostgreSQL client and the dump always comes from the
version that wrote the data, then reads the archive back with
`pg_restore --list`: a dump nobody has parsed is a file, not a backup. It
refused nothing on the first run — 352 KB, 53 tables. The restore was
exercised into a scratch database rather than over the development one, and
every table's row count compared. `restore.sh` refuses unless the name of the
database it is about to overwrite is repeated on the command line, because
the confirmation that cannot be given by accident is the only kind worth
having.

**Correction, made on Day 10.** That verification did not run `restore.sh`.
It ran `pg_restore` by hand with the same flags, which tested PostgreSQL and
left the script — the argument parsing, the guard, the flags as actually
written — unexecuted. The script now takes `TARGET_DB` so the procedure can
be rehearsed against a scratch database without touching the live one, and
it has been: run against a fresh database, then again over the populated
result to exercise the `--clean` path, with row counts compared each time,
and the guard re-checked against the drill target. Writing a restore script
and then verifying something adjacent to it is the same mistake as verifying
the PDF by parsing it instead of reading it.

**Production build.** `check --deploy` under `config.settings.prod` reports
one warning, the placeholder `SECRET_KEY` from the development `.env`.
`collectstatic` post-processes 640 files through the manifest storage.

**Known limitations, unchanged.** Responsive layout is still untested on real
devices; a browser window resized on a laptop is not a phone, and that row
does not move until someone holds one. The printed A4 page still has not been
looked at by a human — more pressing now, not less, since the template that
produces it changed today.

### Day 10 — 2026-08-10 · the two screens that were never built

Both remaining "partial" rows in the requirement table were the same shape:
the service existed, the model existed, and nothing reached either from a
browser. Neither needed new data.

**Child edit (§2.2).** `update_child` has been in `services.py` since Day 3
with no caller. The gate is `can_record_for_child`, not `can_access_child`,
and the difference is the whole point: a guardian passes the read check —
it is her child — but the registration number, the enrollment date and the
health notes are the kindergarten's record of the child, and §2.3 gives a
guardian the portfolio, not that. Both verbs go through the check, since a
view that gates GET and forgets POST is a view that still writes.

The group is deliberately absent from the form. Moving a child is
`transfer_child`, which writes the Enrollment row that
`child_kindergarten_history` reads for authorization (CLAUDE.md §1.2); a
form that quietly reassigned it would move a child with no history behind
them, and the previous teacher would lose access to observations they wrote
themselves. Two tests post the field anyway and assert nothing moved.

**A 500 found on the way.** `uniq_child_national_id` is a partial unique
constraint and nothing checked it before the INSERT, so a teacher who
mistyped a registration number that already existed met a server error
rather than a sentence. Registering a new child had the same hole; the
service test asserted `IntegrityError`, which is to say it asserted the 500. Both paths now check first. The constraint stays — it is still the
guarantee, and checking first only decides which outcome is the common one.

**Self-service profile (§3.3).** `TeacherProfile` shipped on Day 2 and a
teacher had no way to fill in their own specialization, education or years
of service. No id in the URL: the subject is always `request.user`, which
is what makes this screen safe and also what makes its risks different.
The editable fields are an allow-list, not an exclude-list, because the
failure modes are not symmetric — a forgotten field means somebody cannot
edit their bio, while a field missed on an exclude-list could mean
`is_active`, `is_superuser` or `password` are writable from a form the user
controls entirely. Six tests post exactly those and assert nothing moved.
Teacher fields are ignored rather than refused for non-teachers: the form
does not offer them, so a guardian posting them is noise or an attempt.

Guardians get the same screen without the professional block. §3.5 gives
them a name and a phone number worth correcting, and a page that 404s for a
whole role is a menu entry that has to be conditional in two layouts.

**Requirement 3 and requirement 4 close.** The table is now 14 done, 3
partial, 0 not started; the three partials are deployment (D3), responsive
layout on real devices, and the REST API (D2, deferred by decision).

### Day 10 — somebody finally looked at the PDF

`poppler-utils` goes into the image, a real portfolio is generated through
`request_child_portfolio` → `generate_report` — not the Day 1 font spike —
and all eight pages were rendered with `pdftoppm` and read.

**The good news first.** Cyrillic is correct throughout, including Ө, ө, Ү
and ү in body text, bold headings and table headers. Nothing overflows the
A4 margins. The running header and the "Хуудас N / 8" counter appear on
every page. No English, no template commentary. The §6.4 assessment matrix
and the §10.1 tables are legible and correctly aligned.

**Defect one: `««Би чадаж байна!»»`.** RFP §5.1 asks a teacher to record
"хүүхдийн хэлсэн үг". The template presents it as a quotation and supplies
the guillemets — but the teacher filling in that field has no way to know
that, and quite reasonably quotes it themselves. The seed data does exactly
this, so every observation in the printed portfolio carried doubled quotation
marks. Fixed with an `unquoted` filter in `apps/core/templatetags/`, applied
at the point of presentation rather than on save: the field holds what the
teacher typed, and a service that quietly rewrote their punctuation would be
lying about its own contents. The filter strips one surrounding pair only, so
quotation _inside_ a sentence survives.

**The guard caught its author.** The first version of the comment explaining
that filter was written as `{# ... #}` across two lines — the identical
mistake from Day 9, made by the same hand, one day later. The Day 9 PDF
assertion failed immediately and named `{#` as the leak. That is the whole
argument for artefact-level tests in one incident: the rule was known, the
reasoning was written down, and it was broken anyway within twenty-four
hours.

**Defect two, not fixed: five of eight pages are nearly empty.**
`section { page-break-before: always }` gives every §10.1 section its own
page, which is right for a document that gets printed and punched. But a
section with nothing in it still gets a page, so "Миний тухай",
"Нас тус бүрийн мэдээлэл" and "Эцэг эхийн ажиглалт" each spend a whole A4
sheet on one grey line reading "Бөглөгдөөгүй байна." For a child whose
record is new — which is every child in the first weeks — the portfolio is
mostly blank paper.

Not fixed today because the right answer is a product decision, not a CSS
change. Three options: omit empty sections from the PDF entirely; keep the
heading but let empty sections share a page; or leave it, on the grounds
that a printed placeholder tells a parent the section exists and is waiting
to be filled. The third has a real argument behind it and the client should
be the one to make it. **Open — see D5.**

### Day 10 — the mobile audit at 375px

Not the same thing as testing on a phone, and the checklist row stays ⬜
because of that. What this was: every screen examined at 375px against the
rules, and the failures that produce no error fixed.

**The one that mattered.** Form controls were `.95rem` — about 15.2px.
Mobile Safari zooms the viewport whenever a focused input is under 16px and
does not zoom back out, so a teacher recording an observation on a phone
would be left panning a form that no longer fits. Every form in the
application was affected. Now 16px, stated in pixels precisely so it does
not get tidied back into a rem figure that happens to land under the
threshold. `base_auth.html` was already `1rem` and was fine.

**Four more, each invisible on a laptop:**

- `.table-wrap` had `overflow-x: auto` but not `min-width: 0`. A flex or
  grid item defaults to `min-width: auto` — its content's width — so the
  wrapper grew to fit the §6.3 grid and the _page_ scrolled sideways
  instead of the table. One property; the whole mechanism depended on it.
- `dl.facts` uses `grid-template-columns: max-content 1fr`, sized to the
  longest label. On the child detail page that is "Эрүүл мэндийн тэмдэглэл",
  which pushed the values off the right edge. Stacks below 560px.
- The activation code, six digits at `2rem` with `.28em` tracking, is about
  300px wide and overflowed its card. Now `clamp()`, with a `text-indent`
  to cancel the trailing letter-space that was pulling it off centre.
- Nav links were about 37px tall against a 44px minimum (§629–635), on a bar
  that also scrolls horizontally — the combination most likely to produce a
  mis-tap. 44px on nav links and buttons at mobile width.

`apps/core/tests/test_responsive.py` guards the parts that can be asserted
without a browser: the viewport meta tag in all four layouts, that no layout
disables pinch-zoom, the 16px floor, `min-width: 0`, and that every table
reaching a browser is wrapped. The report templates are excluded — they go
to A4 through WeasyPrint and never open in one.

**Still outstanding, and not closed by any of this.** Nobody has opened this
application on a physical phone, and the checklist rows for real devices and
for Chrome/Safari/Edge/Android stay ⬜ until somebody does. A narrowed
laptop window shares almost none of what makes mobile hard: touch accuracy,
the on-screen keyboard covering the field being typed into, Safari's address
bar resizing the viewport mid-scroll, or a real network.

### Running totals

|         | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 | Day 8 | Day 9 | Day 10    |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| Tests   | 64    | 93    | 156   | 189   | 278   | 346   | 397   | 505   | **575**   |
| Models  | 14    | 14    | 15    | 18    | 27    | 33    | 34    | 34    | **34**    |
| DoD met | —     | —     | 12/24 | 14/24 | 16/24 | 20/24 | 22/24 | 23/24 | **23/24** |

Models excludes the three `django-simple-history` mirrors.

Day 9 adds no models and no features. Of its 108 new tests, 99 are the
template guard — two assertions run against every template — and 9 are the
error pages. A jump in the test count that buys no new behaviour is what
finding a defect looks like.

Day 10 adds no models either: the two screens are views over services that
already existed, and the rest of the day was spent looking at output rather
than producing it. Of its 64 new tests, 25 came from the PDF and mobile work
and buy no new behaviour at all — they are the cost of two defects that
every existing test had passed straight over. The DoD figure does not move
because the only item left is deployment, which needs a provider rather than
more code.

**A note on the test count.** A full run alongside another full run reports
errors that are not real: `--reuse-db` means both share one database, and
the second run tears down tables the first is still using. Two overlapping
runs produced "556 passed, 13 errors" today; a single clean run of the same
tree produced 569 passed. If the suite reports errors, check nothing else is
running before believing them.

## Decisions

Recorded rather than left implicit, per the original brief's instruction to
surface ambiguity. **All five are now resolved.** One open risk survives
inside D3 and is a legal question rather than a technical one: whether
Mongolian law permits children's records to be held outside the country.

### D1 — MVP scope: growth tracking and document library ✅ resolved 2026-08-09

**Decision: this roadmap governs. Both move to Phase 2**, along with the full
portfolio timeline, milestones, photo albums, term and annual reports, Excel,
activity posts and consent records.

Design spec section 1 has been rewritten to match, with section 1.5 recording
what moved and why. `CLAUDE.md` §7.1, `README.md` and `docs/design/INDEX.md`
now point here for phase boundaries.

**Amended 2026-08-12.** The client confirmed the deferral, then asked for
**`TermReport` specifically to be pulled back into Phase 1**: RFP §20-II
lists "Улирлын тайлан" among the mandatory MVP features and §21.7 makes it
an acceptance criterion, so deferring it meant shipping an MVP that could
not pass its own acceptance test. Built to
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-term-report-design.md`.

The rest of D1's list stays in Phase 2 — the full portfolio timeline,
milestones, photo albums, growth tracking, document library, `AnnualReport`
(§6.5), Excel, activity posts and consent records.

### D2 — "Clean REST API" as a Phase 1 item ✅ resolved 2026-08-09

**Decision: the deferral stands.** Phase 1 ships a server-rendered web
application whose views call `services/` in process. Line 72 of the original
brief requires only that the backend be _designed_ to support a mobile client
later, which the service layer does.

Revisit if a third party needs to integrate before the mobile client exists;
adding DRF on top of the existing services is roughly two days.

### D3 — Hosting and object storage ✅ resolved 2026-08-11

**Decision: Hetzner Cloud, Singapore region, with Cloudflare R2 for files.**
Roughly €12–15/month for the server plus R2 at $0.015/GB stored and no egress
charge.

**Reaffirmed 2026-08-17 after pricing a Mongolian data centre.** Datacom's
VPS was compared directly: their V1 (2 vCPU / 4 GB / 80 GB) is ₮132,000/month
against roughly ₮50,000 for a CPX21, and keeping the photographs in-country
means running MinIO on the same box, which puts the honest starting tier at
V2 (₮198,000) once Postgres, backups, Docker images and 30 days of PDFs are
sharing that disk — about 3.8× Hetzner.

Latency was re-measured from Ulaanbaatar on the day and did **not** justify
the difference: 95 ms average to Hetzner Singapore versus 12 ms to a domestic
host. Three round trips on a cold page load is a quarter of a second, inside
8% of the three-second budget §17 allows, and less than the app's own N+1 or
image-size costs.

**The §12 question is therefore still open, deliberately.** Whether Mongolian
law permits children's data to sit outside the country was raised, priced and
consciously deferred — it is not an oversight. Datacom + R2 was rejected as
the one combination that pays the premium and still stores the photographs
abroad. If the legal answer turns out to be "no", the move is Datacom + MinIO
and the only unexercised work is giving MinIO a public hostname that Django
and the browser resolve identically (see the note in `config/settings/dev.py`).
No application code changes either way — storage goes through Django's
abstraction. **Get a lawyer's answer before the first real family is entered.**

**Latency decided it, and it was measured rather than assumed.** From a
connection in Ulaanbaatar, mean round-trip over three pings:

| Region               | RTT       |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Hetzner Singapore    | **93 ms** |
| Hetzner Nuremberg    | 121 ms    |
| Hetzner Falkenstein  | 128 ms    |
| Hetzner Helsinki     | 141 ms    |
| Hetzner Ashburn (US) | 256 ms    |

Germany was recommended first, on the strength of price and of a GDPR
argument that does not survive contact with the facts — see the corrections
below. Singapore is 30% closer to the people who will actually use this.

**Ownership, RFP §781.** "Source code, сервер, домэйн, database болон cloud
storage-ийн үндсэн эзэмшигч нь захиалагч байна." On a VPS every one of those
is an account in the client's name; handover is a set of credentials. A
managed platform keeps its own internals, which makes that clause harder to
satisfy honestly.

**The domain is `nomadkids.mn`, registered at iTools** (2026-08-14, renews
2027-08-14, ₮150,000/year), the host stays Hetzner.
The registrant must be the client, not the developer — the same §781 clause
covers "домэйн" explicitly. DNS is served by iTools' nameservers with a plain
A record to the Hetzner IP; Cloudflare is in this stack for R2 only and its
proxy stays off, because Caddy issues the certificate itself (see
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §1).

**Two things stated earlier in this project's discussion were wrong, and are
corrected here rather than quietly dropped:**

- _"GDPR protects the children's data."_ It does not. GDPR governs data
  about people in the EU, or processing by an entity established there; a
  Mongolian kindergarten's records are outside its scope wherever the disk
  happens to sit. The real and much narrower benefit is that **Hetzner** is
  bound by it as a processor, which is worth having in a contract but is not
  a protection for the data subjects.
- _"A VPS is ten minutes a month."_ It is not. Security updates, Docker
  upgrades, disk filling, checking that the backup actually ran, and being
  the person who gets woken when something stops — call it one to two hours
  a month, more when something breaks.

**Open risk, not a code question.** Whether Mongolia's 2021 personal data
protection law restricts holding children's records outside the country has
not been established. If it does, it overrides everything above and the
answer becomes a Mongolian data centre. Worth a lawyer's five minutes before
the first real family is entered.

**Operations.** The developer maintains the server (confirmed 2026-08-11),
not the kindergarten. That is the arrangement a VPS assumes; an unmaintained
server is how these get breached.

**Addendum 2026-08-18 — Hetzner account verification blocked the purchase, so
a fallback is now named: DigitalOcean SGP1.**

Hetzner put the new account into manual review ("manual check required") and
no server could be bought. That is an account problem, not an architecture
one — nothing in the code names a provider, so the fallback costs a paragraph
in `docs/SERVER-SETUP.md` and nothing else. The Hetzner-specific walkthrough
was made provider-neutral on the same day and renamed accordingly.

Latency was re-measured from Ulaanbaatar rather than assumed, the same way
the original decision was made. Mean ICMP round-trip, 8–10 packets:

| Provider          | RTT                     | Price (2 vCPU / 4 GB)         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Hetzner Singapore | **99 ms**               | ~€12–15/month (CPX21, 3 vCPU) |
| DigitalOcean SGP1 | **~104 ms**, see caveat | $24/month                     |
| Vultr Singapore   | 220 ms                  | $20/month                     |

**Vultr was measured out, not priced out.** It is the cheapest of the three
and was the obvious first fallback, but it came back at 197–239 ms with 0%
packet loss across ten packets, confirmed a second time over TCP handshake —
roughly double Hetzner from this connection. That is an ISP-to-Singapore
routing characteristic and could differ from another network, so the entry
stays in the table with the measurement attached rather than being deleted.
Re-measure before reconsidering it.

**The DigitalOcean figure is the weakest number here and is labelled as
such.** DO no longer publishes a droplet-network ping target in SGP1 —
`speedtest-sgp1.digitalocean.com` has stopped resolving — so what was
actually measured is `sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com`, the Spaces object-storage
endpoint, which need not share a path with a droplet. The Hetzner figure
corroborates D3's independent 93 ms; this one corroborates nothing. Confirm
it against an hourly droplet (about $0.04) before committing.

DigitalOcean is 5 ms behind Hetzner and about 1.7× the price: roughly $10 a
month to stop waiting. The rule recorded for the client is **two business
days** — if Hetzner's review has not cleared by then, buy the Droplet.

**iTools was checked as a domestic option on 2026-08-18 and does not fit.**
It sells no VPS. Its shared hosting (₮180–300k/year) has neither Docker nor
root, so Celery, WeasyPrint and `libmagic` cannot be installed at all, and
its dedicated servers start at ₮600,000/month for 8 cores and 32 GB — roughly
12× Hetzner for four times the machine this needs. The specification also
caps **international bandwidth at 5 Mbps** while domestic (MIXX) is
unmetered, which sharpens D3's existing point: a domestic host has to run
MinIO on the box, because pushing every uploaded photograph to Cloudflare R2
over a 5 Mbps international link is about 8 seconds for a 5 MB file. Domestic
hosting remains viable through Datacom's VPS or Cloud.mn (pricing is behind a
login and needs a sales enquiry) — not through iTools, which stays in this
project as the domain registrar only.

**Datacom's VPS pricing was re-checked the same day and D3's figures hold:**
V1 ₮132,000/month (2 vCPU / 4 GB / 80 GB), V2 ₮198,000/month (4 vCPU / 8 GB /
160 GB), V3 ₮374,000, V4 ₮726,000. Three things the pricing page does not say,
each of which this system depends on, and none of which should be paid for
before being confirmed with their sales desk:

- **Whether Ubuntu 24.04 and root are on offer at all.** The page advertises a
  control panel and VNC but never names an operating system. No Docker, no
  deployment.
- **The disk is "SSD/HDD хослосон" — mixed, not pure SSD.** Which tier
  PostgreSQL lands on is worth asking.
- **VPS payments are explicitly non-refundable.** Hetzner and DigitalOcean bill
  by the hour and a wrong guess costs cents; Datacom does not, which is also
  why the latency confirmation above should happen on an hourly provider.

**A numeric trap worth writing down.** Datacom's shared hosting is ₮198,000
**per year** and its V2 VPS is ₮198,000 **per month** — the same figure, a
twelvefold difference. The shared tier cannot host this system under any
circumstances: it is cPanel, PHP 8, Apache and MySQL, with no Docker, no root
and no PostgreSQL. The same disqualification applies to iTools' shared tier.
Only the VPS line is a real option.

Hetzner's review most commonly fires on a name mismatch, which this project
invites: §781 puts the account in the client's name while the developer holds
the card. Matching the two, and sending identification to `support@hetzner.com`
before being asked, is the fastest way through.

**Previously considered:** managed PaaS (Railway/Render, ~$30–60/month, less
operational load, weaker fit with §781) · Mongolian data centre (lowest
latency, no legal question, higher cost and S3-compatible storage would need
confirming) · Vultr Singapore (see the addendum above — measured out).

The media layer runs against any S3-compatible bucket through Django's
storage abstraction, with MinIO standing in locally, so this was never a code
decision — `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` needed one paragraph changed once the answer
arrived. Deferred twice at the client's request before being settled.

### D4 — Deferred until their own phase

Recorded so they are not forgotten: observation tags and the teacher
confidence rating shown in the mockups, the separate child display code
(`CHD-0002`) alongside the registration number, and per-kindergarten storage
quotas. None block Phase 1.

### D5 — Empty sections in the printed portfolio ✅ resolved 2026-08-11

**Decision: option 1 — omit empty sections entirely.** Found on Day 10 by
rendering a real portfolio and looking at it; decided by the client the
following day.

Implemented in `builder.py` rather than the template, because the template's
job is to lay out what it is given (CLAUDE.md §2.1) and because "does this
section have anything in it" is the same question the request form will need
when it stops offering checkboxes for sections that would render blank.

`basic` is never dropped: it is the registration record, and the child exists
by definition. The assessment matrix counts as empty when no term holds a
value — a grid of dashes tells a family nothing they did not already know.
The filter can only ever narrow the requested set, never widen it, and there
is a test that says so.

Measured on the artefact, not inferred: the demo portfolio went from **8
pages to 5**, and a child registered this morning now gets **3 pages instead
of 8**.

The original three options are kept below, because the reasoning for
option 3 was real and someone may revisit it.

`section { page-break-before: always }` gives each §10.1 section its own
page, which is correct for a document that is printed, punched and kept — a
section split across a fold is unreadable. The consequence is that an _empty_
section also gets a page. In the demo portfolio, five of eight pages carry a
heading and one grey line: "Бөглөгдөөгүй байна." For a newly enrolled child
that is most of the document.

**Options:**

1. **Omit empty sections.** Shortest document, no wasted paper. A parent
   cannot tell whether a section is missing or does not exist.
2. **Let empty sections share a page.** Keeps every heading visible, drops
   the blank sheets. Slightly weakens the "one section, one page" rule for
   the sections that do have content after them.
3. **Leave it.** A printed placeholder tells a family the section exists and
   is waiting — which for a kindergarten filling in a portfolio over three
   years is arguably the point.

Option 3 was a real position, not a non-answer, which is why this was asked
rather than decided.
