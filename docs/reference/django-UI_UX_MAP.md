# Phase 1 UI/UX map

**Date:** 2026-08-17 · **Branch:** `feat/ui-redesign` · **Status:** for approval, nothing implemented

Supersedes the mockup-fidelity direction of the same day. The client's
mockups return to being a _visual reference_; they are no longer the layout
acceptance target for Phase 1.

**Direction:** clean · simple · modern · warm · fast —
"modern calm SaaS + private child portfolio".

**Core principle:** one screen, one primary job.

---

## 0. What this changes

The mockup-fidelity audit produced a P0 to rebuild the assessment screen as a
children × 9-domain matrix. **That is now cancelled.** Assessment stays one
domain at a time, which is what the backend does and what the current screen
already implements.

Backend work started on that matrix has been reverted:
`apps/assessment/{selectors,services,views}.py` are back to their approved
state, assessment tests pass, ruff clean. The redesigned
`templates/assessment/group_grid.html` from the approved checkpoint is
untouched.

**Net effect: most of this map is already built.** The gaps are listed in §7.

## 1. Design tokens

The specified palette is within a few points of what is already in
`app.css` — no visual re-tune needed, but the exact values should be adopted
so the source of truth is unambiguous.

| Token       | Specified                                   | Current   | Action                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Background  | `#F8F7F4`                                   | `#faf9f6` | Adopt                              |
| Surface     | `#FFFFFF`                                   | `#ffffff` | —                                  |
| Primary     | `#6C63FF`                                   | `#6c63ff` | —                                  |
| Text        | `#26242B`                                   | `#25232a` | Adopt                              |
| Muted       | `#77737D`                                   | `#817e8a` | Adopt                              |
| Border      | `#E9E6E0`                                   | `#ece9e4` | Adopt                              |
| Accents     | mint · soft blue · soft yellow · soft peach | same four | —                                  |
| Radius      | 14–18px                                     | 12–18px   | Adopt 14 as the small step         |
| Interactive | ≥44px                                       | ≥44px     | — already enforced and tested      |
| **Inputs**  | **≥48px**                                   | **~42px** | **Change** — one rule in `app.css` |

Everything else — shadows, spacing scale, type scale, badges, buttons —
already matches the brief's description.

## 2. Navigation

### Teacher — specified

`Dashboard · Children · Observations · Assessment · Portfolio · Reports`
(+ profile, which exists)

### ⚠️ Four of these six have no teacher-level route

This is the one genuine blocker in the map and it needs a decision before
any nav work starts. Every route below is real; the problem is what a
top-level menu item would link to.

| Nav item     | Existing route              | Scope     | Usable as a menu item?                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard    | `dashboard:teacher`         | teacher   | ✅ yes                                                                          |
| Children     | `children:list`             | teacher   | ✅ yes                                                                          |
| Observations | `observations:review_queue` | teacher   | ✅ yes — but it is the _parent-submission review queue_, not "all observations" |
| Assessment   | `assessment:group_grid`     | **group** | ⚠️ needs a group id; a teacher may hold several                                 |
| Portfolio    | `portfolio:overview`        | **child** | ❌ no child-independent route exists                                            |
| Reports      | `reports:request`           | **child** | ❌ no child-independent route exists                                            |

**Three options, in order of preference:**

| Option                                 | Nav                                                                  | Cost                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — build the nav from what exists** | Dashboard · Children · Ажиглалт хянах · Үнэлгээ · Мэдэгдэл · Профайл | Zero new screens. "Үнэлгээ" links to the teacher's group; if they hold more than one, it goes to a small chooser |
| B — add two thin index screens         | Full six as specified                                                | Two new views + templates ("pick a child, then portfolio / report")                                              |
| C — keep the current five-item nav     | as built today                                                       | Zero                                                                                                             |

**Recommendation: A.** It reaches every Phase 1 capability, invents no
screens, and Portfolio and Reports stay where users actually reach them —
from a child.

### Parent — specified

`Home · Portfolio · Notifications`

Same issue, smaller: Portfolio is child-scoped. For a guardian with one
child — the common case — the shell can resolve it. With two, the child
switcher on Home already decides.

**Recommendation:** Home · Portfolio (resolved from the selected child) ·
Notifications. Profile and logout stay in the header, not the bar.

Current parent bottom bar is `Нүүр · Мэдэгдэл · Бүртгэл` — this replaces
`Бүртгэл` with `Портфолио` and moves profile to the header.

## 5. Assessment — confirmed shape

**One domain at a time.** Group + term + domain selectors, then one row per
child with four level chips.

This is exactly what is built and tested today. **No work required.**

The matrix is explicitly out of Phase 1 and would need a new selector, a
widened save contract and a mobile strategy — none of which is being spent.

---

## 6. What already matches this brief

Built, tested, and consistent with the direction — **no rework**:

- Design tokens, spacing, type scale, badges, buttons, icons
- Teacher dashboard (3 quick actions, 4 stat tiles, recent observations, no charts)
- Children list (compact rows desktop / cards mobile, search, `Хүүхэд нэмэх`)
- Teacher child detail (identity, actions, observations, assessment, guardians)
- Observation form (sections, one page, visibility, photo)
- Observation list, assessment grid, portfolio overview
- Notifications list + detail (unread dot + word, no feed UI)
- Reports request + status
- Parent home, parent child detail
- Responsive at all five widths, 44px targets, zero overflow
- Security, permissions, media, Celery, WeasyPrint, 932 tests

## 7. Gaps against this brief

Ordered by effort, smallest first.

| #   | Gap                                                                                                                           | Where                                         | Effort                        |

| 2   | Adopt the four exact token values                                                                                             | `app.css`                                     | XS                            |

| 4   | Parent bottom bar: replace `Бүртгэл` with `Портфолио`, move profile to header                                                 | `base_parent.html`, `bottom_nav.html`         | S                             |
| 5   | Teacher nav rename/reorder per option A                                                                                       | `base_teacher.html`                           | S                             |
| 6   | Parent home has **no development progress section** — assessment data exists and the brief lists it under parent child detail | `children/parent/home.html` or `detail.html`  | S                             |
| 7   | Teacher nav "Үнэлгээ" needs a group; chooser required if a teacher holds several                                              | `base_teacher.html` + possibly one small view | M — **needs the §2 decision** |
| 8   | Observation form uses five numbered section cards; brief says "not five large cards — headings and whitespace"                | `observations/form.html`                      | M                             |

**Not in this list on purpose:** the assessment matrix, the teacher top bar,
child-detail tabs, the report preview, and PDF donut charts. All were
mockup-fidelity items and are now out of scope.

---

## 8. Proposed checkpoint order

Small and verifiable, one at a time, stopping after each:

1. **Tokens + inputs + dashboard tiles** (gaps 1–3) — one CSS pass, one template
2. **Navigation** (gaps 4, 5, 7) — after the §2 decision
3. **Parent development section** (gap 6)
4. **Observation form density** (gap 8)

Each with: full pytest · ruff · `makemigrations --check` · responsive probe at
375 / 390 / 768 / 1024 / 1440.

---

## 9. Decisions needed before implementation

1. **Teacher navigation** — option A, B or C from §2? Portfolio and Reports
   have no child-independent route, so the six-item menu as literally
   specified cannot be built without inventing two screens.
2. **"Үнэлгээ" for a multi-group teacher** — link to the first group, or add
   a chooser?
3. **Parent development progress** — on Home, on child detail, or both? The
   brief lists it under parent child detail; the audit found it drawn on the
   Home mockup.
4. **Dashboard tiles: drop from 4 to 3?** The fourth is "birthdays today",
   which is real §12.1 data and cheap to keep.

Nothing is implemented. Awaiting approval.
